# SpotifySentences
medwardson.ca/spotifysentences

Creates a playlist that spells out the desired sentence.

Example:
"I want to dance with somebody" --> https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7JOtXgULowB5PlVYURBBFT

Steps:
  1. Login through homepage using your Spotify Account
  2. Enter the sentence you wish to transform.
    a. It is suggested that you try to avoid punctuation. Although there is
       some preventative measures in place, best results will come with no
       punctuation.
    b. Consider that not all words correlate to song names. We only query the top
       50 search results, so an unknown/obscure song could be flooded by others.
  3. Enter the desired playlist title.
  4. If the conversion works, you will get a link to the playlist. If there were no results, you
     will be redirected to the search page and prompted to try again.
